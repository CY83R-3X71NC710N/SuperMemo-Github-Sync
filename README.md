# Why not other backup solutions?:
Dropbox or Google Drive may seem like a convenient option for backups, but they can actually be inadequate for a number of reasons. These include:

- Possibility of file corruption due to file locks
- Risk of syncing errors resulting in partial backups
- More expensive in the long run due to storage costs
- May not provide the same level of security and privacy as a dedicated backup solution
- Lack of flexibility and control over backups
- Instead, using a version control system like Git is a better option as it is specifically designed for managing and tracking changes to files and folders, it also provides atomic transactions which means it either completely succeeds, or completely fails, there is no situation where your collection data gets partially backed up.
